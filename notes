# Mini Challenge 1

 

## Blog Project: Phase I

 

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Create a new python3 virtual environment.

2. Activate your new virtual environment.

3. Install django.

4. Leverage django-admin to create a new django project inside your `blog` directory (~/Code/SDGKU/blog).

4.1. Your `manage.py` file should be at the root of your project directory.

4.2. Your configuration directory should be named `config`

4.3. Do not continue if the last two points aren't correct.

5. Create 3 django apps:

5.1. pages

5.2. posts

5.3. accounts

6. Create and configure a directory for templates, and subdirectories for each app.

7. Create a base.html directory within your templates directory, which will serve as the parent template for all child templates within this project.

8. Create a home page.

9. Create an about page.

10. Make sure your site is navigable, such that all pages are accessible by clicking on links.

## Note

Your home page should, at a minimum, explain the purpose of the app, while your about page can be about you or a fictional company.

 

## Bonus

Add support for bootstrap, custom CSS and other static files to make the site look to your liking.

4. Make sure your site is navigable (everything is reachable via links).
